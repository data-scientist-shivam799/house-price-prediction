# house-price-prediction

The house price prediction project in Python involves developing a machine learning model that can predict the prices of houses based on various features such as the location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors. The project typically involves collecting and preprocessing the data, selecting the appropriate features, and training and evaluating a machine learning model using algorithms such as linear regression. The accuracy of the model is typically assessed using metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared value, and the model can be used to make predictions on new data.
